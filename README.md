# RRMC

RRMC refers to rock-paper-scissors recognition based on monocular camera.

This project recognizes basic rock-paper-scissors gestures based on a monocular camera in unity, and implements simple human-computer interaction.



## Task List

- [x] Call the external camera through unity3D and get the camera screen

- [x] Implement a program to recognize rock-paper-scissors gestures

- [x] Realize the  interaction between Instantly captured image data and the program above

- [x] Implement simple CPU response to user gestures in unity3D

- [x] Further improve the human-computer interaction logic, scene and graphical interface

- [x] Realize multi-round man-machine guessing effect

- [x] Optimize the gesture recognition program, improve the accuracy and avoid the misidentification by contour search

- [ ] Improve the overall program, refine the UI, and produce a simple demonstration version
